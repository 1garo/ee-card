# EE CARD

### Company Credit Card that the employees can rent

The idea is that the employee is able to rent a cash card with more quota than he usually have, and use it on a vacation, buying something for him or his family, 'cause many times personal cards you have to be with the same company for a long time to get more quota/limit.

  * [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
  * [express](https://expressjs.com/)

## Usage

* Endopoints:
  * /employee - [GET and POST];
  * /card - [GET and POST];
  * /company - [GET and POST];

**I'm still developing the back-end and modeling the db, after it i'll start the front.**
