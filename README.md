# EE CARD

### Company Credit Card that the employees can rent

The idea is that the employee is able to rent a cash card with more quota than he usually have, and use it on a vacation, buying something for him or his family, 'cause many times personal cards you have to be with the same company for a long time to get more quota/limit.

  * [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * [electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
  * [express](https://expressjs.com/)
  * [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) ``` aim to use the db on docker later on```
  * [typeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/)

 
## Usage
**create .env file with the following content:**

```python
DB_HOST=<hostname>
DB_USER=<username> 
DB_PASS=<password>
DB_NAME=<table_name>
```

**replace username/password/database on the ormconfig.json:**

```python
"username": <username>,
"password": <password>,
"database": <db_name>,
```

* Endopoints:
  * /employee - [GET and POST];
  * /card - [GET and POST];
  * /company - [GET and POST];

**I'm still developing the back-end and modeling the db, after it i'll start the front.**
