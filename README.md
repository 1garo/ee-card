# EE CARD API

### Company Credit Card that the employees can rent

The idea is that the employee is able to rent a cash card with more quota than he usually have, and use it on a vacation, buying something for him or his family, 'cause many times personal cards you have to be with the same company for a long time to get more quota/limit.

For the sake of learning, I deployed a beta version of the code today (28/09) on aws cloud(18.220.31.149), the endpoints you can see below.

The endpoint is not working anymore, Free Tier Usage Limit :( 

## Docker Usage
```
- docker build -t ee_card_server .
- docker-compose up/down | start/stop containers

- docker-compose exec database bash | interactive bash with db (database is the default service name).
root@...:/# psql -h <service-name> -d <db_name> -U <username>
- docker-compose exec server bash | interactive bash with server
```
## API Usage
**create .env file with your following info:**

database and 5432 are the default, only change if you know what are you doing.

```python
POSTGRES_USER=<user> 
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<pass> 
POSTGRES_DB=<db_name>
POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@database:5432/db_name
PORT=8000 
DB_PORT=5432
INTERNAL_DB_PORT=5433
```

**replace username/password/database on the ormconfig.docker.json:**

```python
"username": <username>,
"password": <password>,
"database": <database>
```
