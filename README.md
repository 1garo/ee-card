# EE CARD

### Company Credit Card that the employees can rent

The idea is that the employee is able to rent a cash card with more quota than he usually have, and use it on a vacation, buying something for him or his family, 'cause many times personal cards you have to be with the same company for a long time to get more quota/limit.

POSTGRES_USER=<user> 
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=<pass> 
POSTGRES_DB=<db_name>
POSTGRES_URL=postgres://user:pass@database:5432/db_name
PORT=8000 # this is for the API
```

**replace username/password/database on the ormconfig.docker.json:**

```python
"username": <username>,

"database": <db_name>,
```

  * GET /employee?hash="password-hash"

{
 "firstName": "",
 "lastName": "",
 "age": 0,
 "email": "test@test.com"
}
```
  * /card - GET and POST (WIP);
