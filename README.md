# EE CARD

### Company Credit Card that the employees can rent

The idea is that the employee is able to rent a cash card with more quota than he usually have, and use it on a vacation, buying something for him or his family, 'cause many times personal cards you have to be with the same company for a long time to get more quota/limit.
